Underwater image processing is a prominent area of digital image processing which can be used in various different applications. It is a complex field because of the 
physical features of the underwater environment. They are mainly concerned with light dispersion, absorption and deterioration due to low visibility circumstances. 
This study is divided into two sections. The first section includes the performance examination of several histogram equalization approaches and the second section
is about the color balance method for underwater picture improvements.

The objective is to find an efficient approach for enhancing underwater photographs that have deteriorated due to medium scattering and absorption without the need any
special equipment or understanding of the underwater environment. For achieving this objective, the methods of white balancing, gamma correction, image sharpening,
multiscale fusion and Laplace function are used in this process. This procedure includes two crucial steps. The first step is to figure out how to provide acceptable
inputs and the second step is to choose appropriate weight maps which are the background facts and related algorithms.

In the final results, it is understood that the images are better exposed, saturated and have sharper edges. It can be concluded that this approach provides a
fusion-based technique for improving underwater image quality with little complexity and excellent efficiency.
